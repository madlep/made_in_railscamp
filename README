MadeInRailscamp
===============

Super simple rack middleware to PROVE TO THE WORLD that you made your cool app at railscamp.

Tweaks the generated HTML for get requests to add some text about what you did at railscamp.


To install
==========

Add it as a plugin as normal:
  script/plugin install git://github.com/madlep/made_in_railscamp.git

Then just chuck it in your config.ru file at the root of your project. e.g:
  # Rack Dispatcher

  # Require your environment file to bootstrap Rails
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/config/environment'

  use Madlep::MadeInRailscamp

  # Dispatch the request
  run ActionController::Dispatcher.new


Then you should see railscamp pimping from every page in your app.
